    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
    Cuttlefish or cuttles[2] are marine <a href="#nowhere">molluscs</a> of the order Sepiida. 
    They belong to the class Cephalopoda which also includes squid, octopuses, 
    and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which 
    is used for control of buoyancy.
    </p>
    <p>
    Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with 
    denticulated suckers, with which they secure their prey. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopus, worms, and other cuttlefish.
    Their predators include dolphins, sharks, fish, seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish.
    The typical life expectancy of a cuttlefish is about 1â€“2 years.
    </p>
    <h2>Fossil record</h2>
    <p>
    The earliest fossils of cuttlefish are from the Cretaceous period,[6][7] represented by Ceratisepia 
    from the Late Maastrichtian-Paleocene.[8] Whether the earlier Trachyteuthis is assigned to this order, 
    or to the Octopodiformes, remains unclear.[9]
    </p>
    <h2>Range and habitat</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
    The family Sepiidae, which contains all cuttlefish, inhabits tropical and temperate ocean waters. 
    They are mostly shallow-water animals, although they are known to go to depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft).
    [10] They have an unusual biogeographic pattern; they are present along the coasts of East and South Asia,
    Western Europe, and the Mediterranean, as well as all coasts of Africa and Australia, but are totally absent
    from the Americas.

    <h2>Anatomy and physiology</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Visual system</h3>
    <p>
    Cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, have sophisticated eyes. The organogenesis and the final structure of
    the cephalopod eye fundamentally differ from those of vertebrates such as humans.[14] Superficial similarities
    between cephalopod and vertebrate eyes are thought to be examples of convergent evolution. The cuttlefish
    pupil is a smoothly curving W-shape.[15][16] Although cuttlefish cannot see color,[17] they can perceive
    the polarization of light, which enhances their perception of contrast. 
    </p>
    <h3>Circulatory system</h3>
    <p>
    The blood of a cuttlefish is an unusual shade of green-blue, because it uses the copper-containing protein
    haemocyanin to carry oxygen instead of the red, iron-containing protein haemoglobin found in vertebrates' 
    blood.
