                The
                <b>chicken</b>
                (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglefowl">junglefowl</a>
                species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon
                junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a
                term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male
                that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a
                sexually immature female is called a pullet.

            <p>
                Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not
                kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).[2]<sub>

                </sub>
                Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their
                meat and egg71s) and as pets.

            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <p>
                Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal
                approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in
                a flock will dominate others, establishing a 'pecking order', with dominant
                individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens
                or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order
                until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds,
                to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[34]
